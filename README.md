    "Daily university student at Slovak university (2nd-4th year) with a Marketing, Economic, Finance, Computer/Data science or Mathematics background",
    "Fluent English language",
    "Knowledge of MS Office (Work, PowerPoint, Excel)",
    "SQL, MS Power BI, Python, HTML, JavaScript programming skills"

  "Elaboration": "While the candidate is a graduate student at UCLA Anderson pursuing an MS in Business Analytics, they do not meet the requirement of being a daily university student at a Slovak university. However, they are fluent in English and have extensive knowledge of MS Office, along with significant programming skills in SQL, Python, HTML, and JavaScript. Their skillset in data analytics and product management, along with proven experience in automation and data analysis, aligns with the core responsibilities of the data science internship, just not the location requirement."
}
~~~

* **Final Decision module: Plain Text**

~~~
Final Decision: Reject

Comment: While the candidate possesses a strong technical skillset and relevant experience, they do not meet the fundamental geographic requirement of being a daily university student at a Slovak university, which is critical for the position. Despite their impressive qualifications in data analytics and product management, adherence to all basic requirements is essential in this hiring process.
~~~

From this example, we could see that through initial agent the candidate was passed through the screening, but through muilti-agent it captured geographical limitation, and finally rejected the candidate.
